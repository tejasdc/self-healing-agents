## Self-Healing Architecture

### As Complexity Grows, Architecture Dominates Material
- **Path:** `Readwise/Full Document Contents/Articles/As Complexity Grows, Architecture Dominates Material.md`
- **Search terms:** self-healing, architecture, message-passing
- **Relevance:** Directly describes emergent self-healing properties from message-passing architecture
- **Key excerpts:**
  > "I didn't design this. I didn't set out to build a self-healing architecture. I set out to take the ideas around message-passing seriously and see what happened, and what happened is that the stones started leaning on each other and now there's a bridge."

  > "Each PromptObject carries its own context: identity, memory, goals, constraints. This means any component can pick up where another left off without shared state or centralized coordination."

  > "What I keep coming back to is that self-healing isn't a feature. It's a property of systems that take message-passing seriously."

## Cross-Cutting Themes & Synthesis

Several themes emerged across multiple sources that are particularly relevant to self-healing agent design:

### 1. Decentralization as Resilience
Sources: Ant colonies, mycelium networks, Bitcoin, stigmergy
- No single point of failure
- Components operate with local information only
- Global behavior emerges from local interactions

### 2. Recovery Over Prevention
Sources: Factory.ai Signals, boz.com Antifragile, fault tolerance literature
- Systems that recover gracefully outperform systems that try to prevent all failures
- Fault tolerance > failure elimination
- "We can only eliminate failures we can imagine"

### 3. Feedback as the Fundamental Mechanism
Sources: Jamie Davies, Farnam Street, Capra/Luisi, immune system
- Negative feedback loops maintain stability (homeostasis)
- Positive feedback loops enable adaptation and growth
- All self-healing requires feedback: sense damage, respond, verify repair

### 4. Environmental Traces as Coordination
Sources: Stigmergy, ant colonies, mycelium networks
- Agents coordinate through shared environment, not direct communication
- Reduces coupling between components
- Enables scaling without increasing communication overhead

### 5. Target Morphology / Desired State
Sources: Bioelectricity, ecological succession, prompt objects
- Living systems heal toward an encoded "target morphology"
- Software analogy: declarative desired state that the system continuously reconciles toward
- Self-healing requires knowing what "healthy" looks like

### 6. Redundancy as Feature, Not Waste
Sources: Fungal networks, Bitcoin, immune system
- Biological systems maintain redundant pathways
- Damage routing: when one path fails, others compensate
- Redundancy enables graceful degradation
