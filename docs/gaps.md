# Gaps / Opportunity Space

All identified gaps from research. Our differentiation map.

---

## Plugin Ecosystem Gaps (from plugins research)
1. No automatic error detection without human prompting
2. No closed-loop validation that learned rules actually work
3. No biological self-healing patterns (immune memory, homeostasis, cascading responses)
4. No cross-session pattern recognition at scale beyond 50 sessions
5. No multi-agent self-healing coordination
6. No proactive self-healing (prevention, not just recovery)
7. No formalized error taxonomy with standardized healing strategies
8. No self-healing observability (monitoring the healing system itself)

## Compound Engineering Gaps (from CE analysis)
1. No autonomous healing - human approval always required
2. No continuous health monitoring - reactive, not proactive
3. No knowledge decay management - documentation grows without pruning
4. No adaptive immune response - solutions documented but not automated as defenses
5. No fitness landscape - no tracking of which approaches actually work better
6. No homeostatic regulation - no concept of "healthy baselines" for metrics
7. No symbiotic agent communication - parallel agents are independent
8. No dynamic spawning - fixed agent set regardless of workload
9. No metabolic cost awareness - no dynamic budget management
10. No epigenetic memory - no emergent context-dependent behavior

## Academic Research Gaps (from synthesis)
1. No LLM agent sleep architecture (staged N1/N2/N3/REM for agents)
2. No integration of multiple biological metaphors in one system
3. No benchmarks for self-healing capability
4. No formal model of healing termination (stop signals)
5. No study targeting Claude Code specifically

## Bio-to-Computing Translation Gaps (from synthesis)
1. Glymphatic clearance has no agent equivalent
2. Epigenetic memory is unaddressed
3. Paracrine signaling is missing
4. The blastema concept has no computing analog
5. Circadian rhythm / ultradian cycling not implemented

## Our Unique Opportunities
1. First bio-inspired self-healing plugin for Claude Code
2. First agent sleep architecture (staged cycles)
3. First integration of multiple biological metaphors
4. Bridging /insights to real-time self-healing
5. "Your agents are growing" narrative
6. HLAMT system healing (human + tool)
7. Stigmergic coordination for multi-session agents
8. Degenerate layer that improves existing ecosystem (CE, /insights)
9. Trail evaporation as principled pruning
10. Dream mode for creative problem-solving on solved AND unsolved problems

## Gaps Neither Plugin Addresses (from deep read)
1. No decay/forgetting - both store everything forever
2. No consolidation - no periodic review/synthesis of stored knowledge (no "sleep")
3. No negative learning - can't record failures/reversions as first-class entities
4. No causal modeling - stores WHAT happened but not WHY
5. No conflict resolution - when two memories/learnings contradict, no resolution strategy
6. No proactive retrieval - only searches when asked, never surfaces relevant memories automatically
7. No continuous evaluation - no measurement of whether interventions actually improved outcomes

## Claude Code Prompt-Object Gaps (from Scott Werner mapping)
1. No runtime self-modification - capabilities fixed at session start
2. No inter-object messaging - sub-agents can't message peers, skills don't talk to each other
3. No semantic late binding - tool dispatch is name-based, not semantically interpreted
4. No object creation as recovery - spawning agents is deliberate, not emergent
5. No persistent object identity across sessions - each session is fresh
6. No mutual modification - agents can't modify each other's configuration

## Improvement Opportunities for Existing Systems
- Compound Engineering: contribute improvements back as PR
- Episodic Memory: improve retrieval, add decay/pruning, add negative traces, add cross-project learning
- Claude Reflect: fix broken auto-mode, add non-interactive path, add tests, add semantic detection as default, add temporal decay, add negative learning
- /insights: close the loop from retrospective to real-time
