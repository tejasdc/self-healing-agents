# Presentation / Hackathon Talk

Slide ideas, taglines, and storytelling angles.

---

## Potential Project Name
- **Cloud Code Sleep** (from the sleep-as-healing metaphor)

## Slide Titles / Headlines

1. "Entropy as default - healing as continuous fight against decay"
2. "Temporary performance degradation is a feature, not a bug"
3. "Your agents are healing. Your agents are growing." (token anxiety cure)
4. "Sleep is not downtime"
5. "As complexity grows, architecture dominates material" (Alan Kay)
6. "Recovery over prevention"
7. "Feedback loops over blueprints"
8. "The big idea is messaging, not objects" (Alan Kay)
9. "Sleep is the price the brain pays for plasticity" (Tononi)
10. "Killing is healing" (controlled destruction / apoptosis)
11. "Degeneracy over redundancy"
12. "Compound engineering captures knowledge but doesn't maintain it. Insights diagnoses but doesn't heal. Reflection reflects but doesn't sleep. Nobody's doing staged cyclic autonomous maintenance with creative recombination."
13. "Paper cut vs hemorrhage" - different healing for different severity
14. "The intelligence isn't in any single skill - it's in the hierarchical composition"
15. "Pruning is not optional. It is the cost of being able to learn at all."
16. Trail evaporation: τ(t+1) = (1-ρ)·τ(t) - mathematical pruning
17. "5% explorer ants" - deliberate randomness prevents local optima
18. "4% of GitHub commits by Claude Code, projected 20%+" - self-healing author = high leverage
19. "Agent is scaffolding that eventually transforms the thinker" (Alan Kay)
19b. "Sufficiently structured process hierarchies are indistinguishable from AGI"
20. "A medium that holds new ideas long enough for the human to internalize them" (Kay)
21. "Everyone builds the obvious thing without checking what biology did, what Engelbart did"
22. "Complex things emerge naturally from simple biological principles"
23. "A simple cron job is not sleep. Running your loop all night is not sleep. We need Claude Code Sleep."
24. "Not one genius idea - combining existing ideas into something that works" (Bitcoin analogy)

## Story Arc Ideas

### The biological pitch
- Nature solved self-healing billions of years ago
- We identified universal patterns across all biological scales
- We mapped them to Claude Code's existing architecture
- The result: agents that heal and grow while you sleep

### The Engelbart pitch
- We're building powerful tools but not improving the human system
- HLAMT: the augmentation system includes the human
- Our system upskills both the agent AND the user
- Spaced repetition, progressive disclosure, desire path detection

### The anti-fragility pitch
- Most agent systems are fragile - they break and stay broken
- Some are resilient - they recover to baseline
- Ours is anti-fragile - it gets STRONGER from failure
- Every mistake makes the system better

### The sleep pitch
- When you sleep, your brain consolidates memory, clears waste, prunes synapses, dreams solutions
- When your agents sleep, they do the same thing
- No production AI agent system does this
- "Your agents are healing while you sleep"

## Key Stats to Cite
- VIGIL: Reduced failure notifications from 100% to 0%
- Reflexion: 130/134 task completion on AlfWorld
- "Failure Makes the Agent Stronger": 28-39% improvement through structured reflection
- Darwin Godel Machine: 20% → 50% on SWE-bench through self-modification
- 4% of GitHub commits already by Claude Code, projected 20%+ by end of 2026
- 80% of software features go unused (utilization gap)
- Targeted dream incubation doubles puzzle-solving rates (42% vs 17%)
- Glymphatic system 10x more active during sleep

## Distribution Angle
- Anthropic plugin marketplace distribution
- Install and run immediately
- Some benefits immediate, some compound over time
